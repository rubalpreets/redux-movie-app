# CineFlix: Movie App

[Preview App](https://rubalreduxmovieapp.netlify.app/)

## Description

I developed a movie app using React.js, Axios, React Router, React Redux Toolkit, and Sass. The app features a homepage that displays movies and shows fetched from the OMDB API. It incorporates a search functionality where users can input a search query, and the app fetches relevant results from the OMDB API. Clicking on an individual movie card navigates the user to the movie details page, which is made possible by React Router. The app's state management is handled using React Redux Toolkit, ensuring efficient and predictable state updates throughout the application. The styling of the app is implemented using Sass, providing a flexible and modular approach to styling components. (UI is designed for desktop only)

## Key Technologies and Tools

- **`React.js`**: Leveraged the React.js library for building the user interface components and managing the application's state.
- **`Axios`**: Utilized Axios to handle HTTP requests and fetch data from the OMDB API.
- **`React Router`**: Implemented React Router to enable client-side routing and navigate between different pages of the movie app.
- **`React Redux Toolkit`**: Utilized React Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the React app, ensuring efficient and scalable state management.
- **`Sass`**: Utilized Sass to create modular and reusable stylesheets, providing a flexible and maintainable approach to styling the application.

## Key Features

- **`Movie and Show Listings`**: Displayed a collection of movies and shows on the homepage, fetching data from the OMDB API and rendering the content dynamically.
- **`Search Functionality`**: Implemented a search feature that allows users to input search queries, fetch relevant results from the OMDB API, and display them in real-time.
- **` Movie Details Page`**: Created a dedicated page to display detailed information about a selected movie, enabling users to navigate to the details page by clicking on a movie card.
- **`React Router Navigation`**: Leveraged React Router to enable smooth navigation between different pages of the movie app.
- **`React Redux Toolkit State Management`**: Utilized React Redux Toolkit to manage the application's state, ensuring a predictable and scalable state management approach.
- **`Sass Styling`**: Implemented Sass to create modular and reusable stylesheets, enabling a flexible and maintainable approach to styling components.

## Future Enhancements

The project can be expanded by implementing additional features and functionality, such as:

- **`User Authentication`**: Adding user authentication and authorization to enable personalized experiences and user-specific functionality.
- **`Favorite Movies/Shows`**: Allowing users to mark movies and shows as favorites and implementing a "favorites" page to view and manage their saved content.
- **`Ratings and Reviews`**: Enabling users to rate and review movies and shows, and displaying aggregated ratings and reviews for each title.
- **`Additional API Integrations`**: Integrating other external APIs to provide additional data and enhance the movie app's functionality.
- **`Advanced Search Options`**: Expanding the search functionality to include advanced search options like filtering by genre, year, or rating.

By developing this movie app, I have demonstrated my proficiency in front-end development using React.js, along with integrating external APIs, implementing search functionality, managing the application's state using React Redux Toolkit, and utilizing Sass for modular and maintainable styling. This project showcases my ability to create interactive and dynamic web applications, incorporating essential features for browsing and exploring movie content, while adhering to modern front-end development practices.
